# A Young Art & Technologist’s Manifesto
**A charge for making art with (and without) technology in 2014 by [Brannon Dorsey](http://brannondorsey.com).**

1. Don’t reject. Learn, make, fail, and grow without the intentions to make something that renders something else insignificant.
1. Be minded in the now. Create work that presents something that was only made relevant/possible in the last three years.
1. Teach. Remember that you know only what you do because of the willingness, diligence, and generosity of others.
1. Say that you can do things that you cannot. Learn and do them.
1. Do not feign knowledge.
1. Be excited. You will have presence and influence one day.
1. Invest in the community. Put people and relationships first.
1. Remember that this is only a part, albeit a large part, of the only life that you have.
1. Read, listen, and watch. Always be reading one technical and one theoretical text.
1. Spend months on projects that no one ever sees.
1. Drink coffee.
1. Publish, open source, and share everything.
1. Don’t fear the money you could lose from sharing. Revel in the opportunity to share, collaborate, and spread the work that others have allowed you to.
1. Analyze what you make from the perspective of a painter.
1. Go outside.
1. Be amazed with what you create.
1. Stay unsatisfied with that amazement.
1. Know that what is revolutionary will become obsolete, nostalgic. Understand that this is progress.
1. Remain critical of everything without slowing down.
1. Make to find meaning without a precondition. Remove barriers to entry.
1. Follow [links](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom7/mario/mario.pdf). Open them in new tabs.
1. Know that you will be gone before you are finished.
